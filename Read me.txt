# Employee Dashboard (Local Storage CRUD)

This is a small web project where we can add, edit, view, and delete employee details.  
I built this project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
All the data is stored in the browser using Local Storage, so no database or backend is needed.


## Features

- Add new employees with name, position, and salary  
- Show all employees in a table  
- Edit employee details  
- Delete employee details  
- Data stays saved in the browser even after refreshing  
- Basic form validation and clean UI
